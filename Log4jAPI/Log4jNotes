How to generate logs : using Apache log4j API (Log4j JAR)


How it works: It reads log4j configuration from log4j properties file.

 

We need to create the log4j properties file under the resources folder.
Create a source folder in your project(right click on project>>source folder)>>give name >> src/main/resources
under this folder >> create a file >> name MUST BE log4j.properties
copy the key value pair as written in log4j properties file


JSON/XML --DATA COLLECTORS/standard language to communicate between 2 systems

WebServices : these are API, But we do not download any JAR file..it happens over the network..through http protocol we send the request and then we get the response Over the network..
imp : Authentication in form of Authentication token / Unique ID/Session ID

SOAP API: gone from market
Rest API: we use these API Now-a -days.. over the netwrok in form of http protocol>>webService

API: PURE METHOD which is available in some system and in form of JAR file we use them >> some JAR files are open source>>you can modify  the source code and make your own version.. 
WEbService: Soap based and Rest based
soap based:simple object access protocol>>service interface
rest API: REPRESENTATION STATEFUL API >>a pattern>>architecture type..it can use soap protocols..uses URLI







LINUX >>Open source>> you can customize and create your own operating system..open source..but you cannot modify microsoft as they are licensed
